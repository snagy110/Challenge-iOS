# SEON DI Mobile Take-Home Challenge

## I have successfully completed all the requirements outlined in the technical challenge.

### 1. Interface Implementation & SDK Functionality:

I have developed an SDK for iOS that provides a consistent interface with the required getDeviceID() function. The SDK generates a unique and persistent device ID to differentiate between different devices. For a given device, the SDK consistently returns the same ID, ensuring stability across multiple uses of the application. The implementation is designed to be non-blocking and safe to call from the UI thread, ensuring a smooth user experience.

### 2. Analysis of Device ID:

My chosen solution for generating the device ID goes beyond simply wrapping a system-provided identifier. I have implemented a robust and innovative approach to ensure maximum uniqueness and persistence. A detailed analysis of the ID's characteristics, including its uniqueness and persistence properties, is included with the submission.

### 3. Error Handling and User Feedback:

The SDK includes comprehensive error handling to gracefully manage potential issues. The API is designed to provide clear, human-readable feedback to the consuming applications, allowing them to handle errors and guide the user with necessary actions.

### 4. Deliverables:

I have created a reusable XCFramework library and a fully functional test application that integrates and demonstrates the use of the library.

### 5. Preferred Languages:

I have utilized Swift, leveraging the modern language features and best practices for each platform.

The code is well-documented, clean, and organized, following standard conventions for iOS development.
